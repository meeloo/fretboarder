I have tested and used it on my computers and it worked fine. Let me know (<fretboarder@meeloo.net>) if you find anything strange though.  

## Installation
Dowload the archive for your OS. In the archive you will find one file name fretboarder.dylib on macOS and fretboarder.dll on windows. Copy it to your Fusion 360 add ins folder. More information on how to do that can be found on the [Autodesk Fusion 360 Help site](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/fusion-360/troubleshooting/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/How-to-install-an-ADD-IN-and-Script-in-Fusion-360.html)
